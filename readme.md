## Build

### System Prerequisites
- fontforge
- imagemagick
- potrace

You can install the lot on Ubuntu with:
`sudo apt install fontforge imagemagick potrace`

### GIMP Layout
- Characters are positioned by CP437 code on a 16x16 grid
- Characters are each 6x6 but cropped to 4x4 when exported; for the proportional
  font, character widths are further cropped to their occupancy and may be
  kerned
- Characters are scaled by 10 when exported for accurate SVG tracing
- Exported filename convention is ```_yy_xx.svg``` where yy is row [0, 15]
  and xx is column [0, 15]

Initial GIMP guidelines were drawn using the
[Grid of Guides script](http://registry.gimp.org/node/12003)

### Image Diff
Image diffing with Git is useful for verifying changes but requires a custom
configuration. One possible setup is described in
[git-diff-img](https://github.com/niedzielski/git-diff-img)

### Testing the TTF
On Ubuntu, symlink build/mem.ttf to ~/.fonts. You may need to regenerate your
font cache depending on the change made: `fc-cache -f -v`
