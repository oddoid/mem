## Build

### System Dependencies
- fontforge
- imagemagick
- potrace

### GIMP Layout
- Characters are positioned by CP437 code on a 16x16 grid
- Characters are each 6x6 but cropped to 4x4 when exported; for the proportional
  font, character widths are further cropped to their occupancy and may be
  kerned
- Characters are scaled by 10 when exported for accurate SVG tracing
- Exported filename convention is ```_yy_xx.svg``` where yy is row [0, 15]
  and xx is column [0, 15]

Initial GIMP guidelines were drawn using the
[Grid of Guides script](http://registry.gimp.org/node/12003)

### Image Diff

Image diffing in Git requires a custom configuration. One possible configuration
is to add a shell script to your path, `git-diff-img`:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env sh
# $@ images
exec git difftool -x '
  compare "$LOCAL" "$REMOTE" png:- |
  montage -mode concatenate "$LOCAL" png:- "$REMOTE" png:- |
  display -title "$LOCAL: Local | Diff | Remote" png:-
' "$@"
```

Execute against images only: ```git diff-img **.png```
