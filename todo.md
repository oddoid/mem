## To-do

- Add more demos. How should I duplicate content?
- Clean up the readme. Summarize what's actually available, what works, how
  (e.g., 7px tall in Aseprite but no kerning or Gimp 7px with kerning). Add that
  real precise font info.
- Fix up all the fonts. Only 5x6 has been used lately and the rest need
  maintenance.
- Make monospace font characters occupy 4px wide where possible.
- The font sizes are split across TTF files instead of being in one. Can this be
  fixed?
- Validate the sheets are usable in-game.
- Note code page 437 and many missing characters in the readme.
- Use rndmem.com for domain.
- Add font to oddoid.com with aseprite-atlas.
- Optimize the font loading strategy used in the demos.
- Why did I consider but not use
  `inkscape -z --verb SelectionTrace -l foo.svg ../png/_3_4.png` instead of
  potrace?
- Read through the FontForge docs.
- The font sizes are split across TTF files instead of being in one. Can this be
  fixed?
