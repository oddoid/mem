## To-do

- Clean up the readme. Summarize what's actually available, what works, how
  (e.g., 7px tall in Aseprite but no kerning or Gimp 7px with kerning). Add that
  real precise font info.
- Consider not distributing dist since they're non-deterministic.
- Fix up all the fonts. Only 5x6 has been used lately and the rest need
  maintenance.
- Validate the sheets are usable in-game.
- Make monospace font characters occupy 4px wide where possible.
- Why did I consider but not use
  `inkscape -z --verb SelectionTrace  -l foo.svg ../png/_3_4.png` instead of
  potrace?
- Add more demos.
- Add font to oddoid.com with aseprite-atlas.
- Read through the FontForge docs.
- Clean up these crufty build files.
- The font sizes are split across TTF files instead of being in one. Can this be
  fixed?
